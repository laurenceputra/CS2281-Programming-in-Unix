<h1>CS2281 Lab 6: Listing Processes and Users (Graded)</h1>

<p>
We have investigated 3 kinds of C programs (all of which are useful):
<ul>
<li> pure C programs (e.g. Lab 1);
<li> C programs which use Unix but could be modified suitably
to work on other non-Unix systems (e.g. <tt>U-26-cp-fd.c</tt> and
to a smaller extent, Lab 3); and
<li> C programs which are designed specifically for Unix 
(e.g. <tt>U-16-mysh1.c</tt> and this lab).
</ul>
C programs in the third class, are usually what one might think of as
<i>system programs</i> and may need to be tailored for a particular 
version of Unix.
They make use of Unix system calls and not just the C libraries.
Lab 6 focuses on this kind of program. The objective is to
show how the <tt>ps</tt> command works and 
<b>how you can write your own</b>. 

<p>
Please note that Lab 6 is less difficult than it seems.
Start with Part 1 so that you know how to deal with <tt>/proc</tt>.
What you may find is that it seems difficult because you will 
have to digest various complex man pages. 
The value of Lab 6 is that it gives flavour of what
a realistic system program entails.
If your Lab is fully working, then you will understand that a 
program of the 3rd time, a system program,
requires various Unix and system details to be sorted out (in the end
may not be so difficult). On the other hand, if the Lab is partly working,
you will still get a better understanding of system programming.
In any case, <b>you should aim to get Part 1 working</b>.
<p>
This lab gets you to look carefully at some Unix man pages. You will also get
to make use of some of the example code given during lectures.
In the lab, you will also start encountering details of the real system, some of
which may be not so easy to understand, in such cases, experiments in
the spirit of the sample programs can be used to understand 
what it does and how to use it.
<b>An important takeaway lesson from CS2281 is to employ simple test programs
to explore something on the system.
</b>
There may be details which are not very precisely defined in 
the man pages.
One approach is to read the system source code but that may be a
non-trivial exercise.
It can be much easier instead to do some tests on the system
which can answer the question.
<p>
You might think that finding out information about processes is
difficult involve some "<i>kernel hacking</i>". Traditionally, programs like
<tt>ps</tt> were implemented that way.
However, in modern Unix, one can access the information needed for <tt>ps</tt>
from the <tt>/proc</tt> filesystem. Take note that the
details and structure of <tt>/proc</tt> varies between Unix, e.g. Solaris
is quite different from Linux.
<p>
We already saw in Lecture 9 that
the <tt>/proc</tt> filesystem in Solaris is a kind of "virtual filesystem"
which gives access to the state of each process.
(<i>Linux is similar but the details are completely different</i>).
Every process in the system has a directory in <tt>/proc</tt>.
Look up the process ID (PID) of your shell (using <tt>ps</tt>).
Look at the files in </tt>/proc</tt>, it consists of numbered directories
where each directory corresponds to the pid of a process. 
Compare the files in <tt>ls /proc</tt> with the PIDs from <tt>ps -e</tt>.
Inside each directory, there are various files which either give information
about certain aspect of the process (or can be used to control the process
but we will not cover the control aspect).
<p>
For this lab, you will only need the file <tt>psinfo</tt> which contains
the information needed by <tt>ps</tt>.
The relevant system include file which describes the structures in <tt>/proc</tt> is 
<tt>/usr/include/procfs.h</tt>
(to include in your C program: <tt>#include &lt;procfs.h&gt;</tt>).
The details of <tt>/proc</tt> are described in <tt>proc(4)</tt> of the man pages,
i.e. <tt>man -s 4 proc</tt>. 
Read the <i>DESCRIPTION</i> portion of the man page for <tt>proc(4)</tt>
and the <i>DIRECTORY STRUCTURE</i> section.
The main information you want is
the documentation for  the <tt>psinfo</tt> file and struct.
The <tt>psinfo</tt> file is a file containing
the contents of a <tt>psinfo</tt> struct, thus, the data in the file is in binary,
e.g. in the L-18-* examples, we see how to read and write a struct stored in
a file. 

<p>
You may find that the <tt>/proc</tt> man page contains a lot of information
which you do not fully understand. 
The way to deal with information overload is
to mainly focus on the relevant information
about <tt>psinfo</tt>. The motivation of the Lab is to get some experience with
writing a real system program. Usually several (complex) man pages
may need to be consulted but not all aspects of the man page need to
be understood at once, only the relevant portion.
Again, when in doubt, write some test programs to understand what
is going on. This is part of the learning process which you should get
used to if you are going to write real Unix programs (now or in the future). 
Finding and understanding the system details is also important
as there are points of differences between
various flavors of Unix.
<p>
If you have difficulty understanding 
<tt>/proc/<i>pid</i>/psinfo</tt> where <i>pid</i> is an existing
process ID, I suggest you first write your own test program 
which reads and prints out some fields in
<tt>/proc/<i>pid</i>/psinfo</tt> for a given pid.
This will be more instructive than trying to understand the man page alone.
(Note the <i>italics</i> above, if the PID of a process is 123 
then <tt>/proc/123</tt>.  
There is no file <tt>/proc/pid</tt>).

<p>
<strong>
General assumptions</strong>:
<br>
Assume for simplicity that there are at most 10000 users in the system. 
Note that this does not mean that the numerical value
of the UIDs are numbered consecutively from 1.
You can also assume that there are at most 50000 processes in total
at any one time on sunfire.

<p>
<h2>Part 1: a basic <tt>ps</tt> (40 marks)</h2>
<p>
Write a C program <tt>lab6-part1.c</tt> with the following usage
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> <tt>part1</tt>

<p>
<tt>part1</tt> doesn't take any arguments. 
Part 1 will print the user name (the name of the user owning the process,
e.g. cs2281), process identifier (PID), executable name (FNAME)
and start time of the process (STIME).
This is a subset of what <tt>ps -ef</tt> gives and includes
the UID, PID, part of CMD and STIME columns from <tt>ps</tt>.
For example, running <tt>ps -ef</tt> could give output which looks
something like:
<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
     UID   PID  PPID   C    STIME TTY         TIME CMD
    root  3563  3563   0   Mar 09 ?           0:00 zsched
  cs2281  4210  4149   0 23:04:19 pts/134     0:00 -bash
</pre>
</blockquote>
The result from <tt>ps</tt> tells you the
following information aboout each process:
<ul>
<li> UID=root, PID=3563, FNAME=zsched
<li> UID=cs2281, PID=4210, FNAME=bash
</ul>
The FNAME is the name of the executable which is usually the first argument
displayed in CMD (however, sometimes the command has a dash in front to show
the login shell as illustrated in the example).

<p>
Your program should print the UID, PID, FNAME and STIME information for 
every processes. The following example shows the output for two processes:
<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
     UID   PID            FNAME STIME
    root  3563           zsched Fri Mar  9 04:35:14 2012
  cs2281  4210             bash Thu Mar 22 23:04:18 2012
</pre>
</blockquote>
The <tt>printf</tt> string format used in the output above is: 
<b><tt>"%8s %5d %16s %.24s"</tt></b>.
The time in the STIME column is in the time format given by <tt>ctime(3C)</tt>
(note that the STIME is output differently from the <tt>ps</tt> example).
A header is printed as the first line as shown above and
is aligned with the corresponding columns.
Processes may be printed out in any order of the PIDs.
<p>
<strong>Hints</strong><br/>
<ul>
<li> 
While you can read the contents of a directory, e.g. reading <tt>/proc</tt>, 
it will be simpler to
simply use the <tt>ls</tt> program. You can invoke it using the 
<tt>system(3C)</tt> library function, e.g. 
<tt>U-2-myscript.c</tt>. You can redirect the output of <tt>ls</tt>
into a temporary file and read it from your code.
<li> You will find that it may be useful to have finished Lab 5 although
it is possible to also do Lab 6 concurrently with Lab 5
<li>
The file <tt>/proc/<i>pid</i>/psinfo</tt> can be read either using
the stdio libraries or directly using system calls.
I suggest it can be easier to use stdio but if you wish, you could read
ahead in the slides and code examples and use system calls.
Doing both ways is also instructive (though you should only submit one version).
<li>
You will need the header file: <br>
<blockquote>
<tt>#include &lt;procfs.h&gt;</tt> 
</blockquote>
The actual file with the declarations is <tt>/usr/include/sys/procfs.h</tt>
<li>
You can get the program name from the field <tt>char pr_fname[PRFNSZ]</tt>
in <tt>struct psinfo</tt>.
Similarly the PID can be found there.
The starting time is the <tt>pr_start</tt> field,
its type is the same as as a <tt>struct timeval</tt> (the details
can be found as <tt>struct timespec</tt> in <tt>/usr/include/sys/time_impl.h</tt>). You will need the field <tt>tv_sec</tt> which gives the number of seconds
since the Unix Epoch begun (1 Jan 1970 UTC).
<li>
You may need to <tt>#include</tt> various header files, 
e.g. <tt>&lt;sys/types.h></tt> and <tt>&lt;time.h></tt>.
<li>
You can check your output by comparing with the information
from <tt>ps</tt>. Note that as processes may be starting and terminating,
the processes could be different when <tt>ps</tt> and
<tt>part1</tt> are run.
</ul>

<h2>Part 2: summarizing the user and process information (60 marks + 10 bonus marks)</h2>
<p>
Write a C program <tt>lab6-part2.c</tt> with the following usage
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> <tt>part2 [-p] [-n] [-u] </tt>
<p>
Unlike Part 1, <b>only</b> processes which are <b>login shells</b> 
will be output.
Thus, <tt>zched</tt> from the Part 1 example is omitted.
<p>
The options refer to:
<ul>
	<li> <tt>-p</tt>: print the PID column
	<li> <tt>-u</tt>: print a unique set of UID. This option disables
	other options so that the other options are ignored (there is no error
	if there are other options, just that they are ignored)
	<li> <tt>-n</tt>: (<b>bonus part</b>) print the N column
	which counts the total number of processes with the particular
	login shell as an ancestor. This option <b>only</b> needs
	to be implemented if you are aiming for the bonus marks.
</ul>
The order of columns (if it is output) is UID, PID, N, FNAME, STIME
where the format of UID, PID, FNAME and STIME is as in Part 1.
The N and PID columns should only be printed if the corresponding
option is specified on the command line. 
The format of the N column is <tt>"%3d"</tt>.
The <tt>-u</tt> option only outputs the UID column without any others.

<p>
For example, if the command line is <tt>part2 -np</tt>, the output could
look like: (note that options can be combined in any order,
so equivalent commands are: <tt>part2 -p -n</tt> or <tt>part2 -pn</tt>)
<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
     UID   PID   N           FNAME STIME
  cs2281  4210   2           bash Thu Mar 22 23:04:18 2012
</pre>
</blockquote>
In this example, <tt>cs2281</tt> is using the <tt>bash</tt> shell
and it happens to have one child process, e.g. <tt>vim</tt>.
<p>
In order, to determine the login shell, the environment variable 
<tt>MYSHELLS</tt> gives a list of shells separated by a colon, e.g.
<tt>MYSHELLS=bash:sh</tt> will recognize <tt>bash</tt> and <tt>sh</tt>
as valid shells.
If <tt>MYSHELLS</tt> is not defined, the default is just <tt>tcsh:bash</tt>.
<p>
The <tt>-u</tt> option disables other options. If <tt>-u</tt> is given,
a unique list of users will be printed as the UID column (with header) and
no other columns.
This means that a user logged in multiple times will only be printed once.
<p>
<strong>Hints</strong><br/>
<ul>
	<li> A user can have multiple login shells. You can assume that a
	process is the login shell is if the first character of the 
	command line is a dash
	and the FNAME is one of the approved shells from <tt>MYSHELLS</tt>
	(or the default). The command line can be found in the
	<tt>ps_psargs</tt> field in <tt>psinfo</tt>.
	<li> Obviously, one way of testing is to login multiple times 
	and start various numbers of processes.
	<li> Any process whose ancestor is a login shell counts towards
	the number of processes with the <tt>-n</tt> option. Thus, the shell
	is not necessarily the immediate parent process.
	<li> In <tt>bash</tt>, the following example shows how
	to create an environment variable
	which will be exported to any child process:
<pre class="code">
$ MYSHELLS=bash:sh:tcsh
$ export MYSHELLS
</pre>
This creates a shell variable <tt>MYSHELLS</tt> and the <tt>export</tt> command
which is internal to <tt>bash</tt> marks that variable as being exported
as an environment variable to any child process of <tt>bash</tt>.
<li> You may find it useful to create your own arrays of appropriate C <tt>struct</tt> to store information about the processes, users, etc.
</ul>
